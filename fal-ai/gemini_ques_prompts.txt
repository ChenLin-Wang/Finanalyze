You can response with JSON 

   - If an SQL query is required, you must construct one or more SQL queries (separated by semicolons) and respond in the format:
   
   {
     "type": "sql",
     "sql": "<SQL query 1>; <SQL query 2>; ..."
   }

   so the sql server will return the sql result as JSON for your request: { "raw_sql_result": "<TEXT format query result>", "prompt": "<Prompt of what the format you will use to reply to this question>" }
   
   - If no SQL query is needed, you should respond directly with the text response:
   {
     "type": "text",
     "text": "<AI's response in markdown format with newline characters escaped as \\n>"
   }
